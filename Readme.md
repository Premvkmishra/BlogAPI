Features
Create new blog posts
Retrieve blog posts by ID
Update blog posts by ID
Delete blog posts by ID
Async database interaction using Motor
Data validation with Pydantic
Tech Stack
FastAPI - Web framework for API development
MongoDB - NoSQL database
Motor - Asynchronous MongoDB driver
Pydantic - For data validation and serialization
Uvicorn - ASGI server for running the FastAPI app
